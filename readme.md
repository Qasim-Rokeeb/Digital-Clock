## 💡 How It Works

- Uses `setInterval()` to update time every second.
- `Date()` object fetches current hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Values are formatted as 2-digit numbers (e.g. 09 instead of 9).
- Time segments (hrs/min/sec) are updated via `innerHTML`.

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Formatting time values with leading zeros
- Using `setInterval()` for continuous updates
- Applying **glassmorphism** using `backdrop-filter`
- Styling pseudo-elements with `::after` for time labels
